# Finding-the-best-classification-algorithm-as-per-accuracy-for-a-given-dataset-problem-
I took a sample dataset. In that dataset, gender is the dependent variable. I first cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns. Then we categorized gender into male, female, brand and unknown and found out the number of users under each category. Then we used feature engineering on link bar and sidebar colours. I used ‘logistic regression’, ‘SVM’ and ‘KNN’. Out of three, I found that “logistic regression” has more accuracy. In the program, I tried to find the accuracy of determining genders using link and sidebars as well as words in description and texts. In those two, description and texts gave more accurate output.
